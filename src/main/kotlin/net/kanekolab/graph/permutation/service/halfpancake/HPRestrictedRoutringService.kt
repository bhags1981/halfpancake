 * 3. Restricted routing in a half pancake graph
    For a source node s = (s1,s2,...,sn), a destination node
    d = (d1,d2,...,dn), two permutations of (n − n˜) integers
    a = (a1,a2,...,a_(n−n˜)) and b = (b1,b2,...,b_(n−n˜)),
and an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n˜), we give an algorithm, HR, that returns
a path unique to i from s to d without visiting two
pancake graphs that are induced by the nodes whose rightmost
permutations of (n−n˜) elements are (a1,a2,...,an−n˜)
and (b1,b2,...,bn−n˜). This algorithm can be invoked by
HR(s,d,a,b,i).
